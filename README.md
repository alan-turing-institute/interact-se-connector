# Interact Search Engine Connector

The Interact Search Engine Connector (isec) updates the search index for [Interact's](https://www.interactsoftware.com/) Search Engine feature.

** This has been developed independently from Interact and is not supported by them. **


## Todo

- [x] setup.py / pyproject.toml
- [ ] Local pyenv
- [x] Check whether args are passed with '-' or '_'
- [ ] Option to represent the base page URL if it is not available from html header
- [x] Option to derive base page URL from git repo (catch case where there is multiple repos).
- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Publish as GitHub Action
- [ ] Unit tests on CI
- [ ] Publish to PyPI
- [ ] Solve how to delete old/stale page index entries
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Docs + Docstring
- [x] Linting
- [ ] Typing
- [x] Link CLI to main methods
- [ ] Force option
- [ ] Dry-run option
- [ ] Add Author option
- [ ] Add summary option
- [ ] Add is_public option
- [ ] Add security page access options
- [ ] Meaningful error codes
- [ ] Filter by doc_id prefix
- [ ] Test `test_do_walk` is too slow. Need to make this run on subsample, not entire source books.
