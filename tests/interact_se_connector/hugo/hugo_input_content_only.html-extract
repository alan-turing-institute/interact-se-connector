<p>Lightning Talks are a meeting series within the tech talk slots in which people give short 10 minute talks.
    The main goals are to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Regularly share what we’re working on.</li>
    <li>Find overlaps between projects or problems someone else in the team could help with.</li>
    <li>Generate ideas for future tech talks.</li>
    <li>Do all this without a big time commitment, both for presenters and attendees.</li>
</ol>
<p>The talks can be on any topic, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A project (including one that hasn’t started yet).</li>
    <li>A tool or technique you use.</li>
    <li>Something you’d like help with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Informal talks or discussions without slides or much preparation are encouraged and very welcome!</p>

</h2>
<p>Each slot will be <strong>10 minutes</strong> with a few minutes after for questions.
    We will be fairly strict with time to make sure everyone on the agenda gets to present.</p>
<p>You can choose whatever format you like (slides, markdown, notebook, freestyle…), but remember that it’s a short slot
    which lends itself to concise, high-level overviews of a topic.
    For example, if your talk is on a project you may wish to cover the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Background: The domain area, context, problem <em>etc.</em>.</li>
    <li>Goals: What are the aims of the project?</li>
    <li>Status: What’s been done so far, example results (if any).</li>
    <li>Tools &amp; Techniques: What you’re using, what you’ve learnt, what you’d like help with.</li>
    <li>Summary: who’s working on the project, dates, GitHub link <em>etc.</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’d like to prepare slides, there’s a PowerPoint template and examples from previous talks under <a

    that can help you get started.</p>
